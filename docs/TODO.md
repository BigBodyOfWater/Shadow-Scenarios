>#### To Do ####

 [ ] Finish setting up discord
 [ ] Add Welcome Screen Info
 [ ] Polish up Gurdian Angel 
    [ ] Change AI slots to randomization (see video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGN3Ywc74k0&list=PLACt0Y23f-92UjVNKiODHzA9pnnGl-Lpj&index=13 minute = 13:50+)
    [ ] Add randomization to AI groups (see video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9csubqv954&list=PLACt0Y23f-92UjVNKiODHzA9pnnGl-Lpj&index=14 minute = 6:50+)
    [ ] Under Waypoints use AIWaypoint_Wait.et for security to prevent AI from moving unless attacked
    [ ] Duplicate AIWaypoint_defend_small.et, change radius to 7.0 to keep them in buildings; turn on fast init 

 [ ] Polish up Silent Depths 
    [ ] Add sub and make it a destructible component 
    [ ] Change AI slots to randomization (see video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGN3Ywc74k0&list=PLACt0Y23f-92UjVNKiODHzA9pnnGl-Lpj&index=13 minute = 13:50+)
    [ ] Add randomization to AI groups (see video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9csubqv954&list=PLACt0Y23f-92UjVNKiODHzA9pnnGl-Lpj&index=14 minute = 6:50+)

[ ] Under common can change perception factor (w/o CRX) == adjust for all units 

[ ] Add AI scalability based on player presence 
[ ] Add Randomization to make each iterastion slightly different

[ ] Add a Recon Task from start to finish to get a SALUTE report (restart server) - one life event. 
# When adding this it'll be important to keep same AI locations; however, it eliminates the unique replayability component. Could adjust AI types to random and move around patrols. Alternatively, could drop the Recon componeent and add a randomization layer pick to modify the locations of AIs in AO for replayability purposes. 

>#### Completed Activity âœ“ ####
