### Welcome to Beard's Arma Reforger Scenarios! 

Embark on an immersive journey through custom, story-driven scenarios. Throughout each story line, you will have the opportunity to jump and play between two elite units: (1) US Marines Special Operations Company (M.S.O.C.), or RUS Spetsial'nyye Operatsii Naval'nogo Desanta (S.O.N.D.) . Each scenario is part of a larger narrative, organized into "chapters", and comes complete with OPORDS, FRAGOS, logistics, story twists, and much more.

### How To Play

1. Pick an MOS at initial load in (you can customize it further and save it). 
2. Follow the in-game tasks and complete the tasks to progress. 
3. Exfil will reset the server, and start the scenario over (Try it again! You'll have a different experience). 

For the best experience, we highly recommend reading the introduction to each chapter. It contains essential hints and tips, including clues to uncover hidden easter eggs. 

You can play it solo or with as many as 22 friends. AI's have been modified to provide a more realistic feel, allowing you to sneak up on them and have more immersive battles.
